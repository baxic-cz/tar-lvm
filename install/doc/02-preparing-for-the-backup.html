                    The created archives and logs are thus written directly to the mounted backup device or to the <em class="italic">SSHFS</em> network filesystem using the <em class="italic">SFTP</em> protocol.
                    However, bare in mind that the direct access method for storing the backups can be used just for a single physical machine and its <em class="italic">KVM</em> virtual machines, all other hosts (either physical or virtual) must use <em class="italic">SSHFS</em> if they want to store the archives and logs to the same storage.
                  </p>
                  <p class="block">
                    This means that the backup destination can be a network storage accessible via <em class="italic">SSH</em> (e.g. a <em class="italic">NAS</em>) or any device directly connected to one of the physical machines with <em class="italic">Linux</em> (such a a large <em class="italic">RAID</em> array or simply a hard drive).

                  <p class="block">
                    There&#039;s one more viewpoint that should be taken into account when choosing the backup storage. If it is intended to be accessed directly from one physical machine and its <em class="italic">KVM</em> virtual machines, then the <em class="italic">Tar-LVM</em> suite must be triggered from that physical machine to be able to attach the backup device to each machine sequentially and not concurrently. All other hosts using the <em class="italic">SSH</em> access method can be then backed up in parallel and the backup process may be triggered from the physical machine as well, from each backed-up host or from any other host.

                    If you want to achieve minimal downtime of your services and still be able to create consistent backup of a snapshot of whole operating system, most of its filesystems must be located on <em class="italic">LVM</em> devices with suitable layout. The reason is simple. If a snapshot of a running system is to be created, all filesystems must be remounted read-only during the snapshot creation and those that are not located on <em class="italic">LVM</em> and thus are unable to create snapshots, must stay remounted read-only during the whole backup process.

                    As you can see and as it was mentioned above, all fileystems don&#039;t have to be necessarily created on LVM volumes. Those of them that are mounted read-only during normal operation (i.e. most of the time - except maintenance) don&#039;t need to meet this condition.
                  </p>
                  <p class="block">
                    Depending on your filesystem layout, those are usually filesystems mounted to the <em class="italic">/boot</em> or <em class="italic">/usr</em> directories and even the root filesystem <em class="italic">/</em> itself can stay read-only most of the time if there are separate partitions or volumes for writable locations like <em class="italic">/var</em>, <em class="italic">/srv</em>, <em class="italic">/opt</em> etc. The <em class="italic">/dev</em> or <em class="italic">/run</em> (<em class="italic">/var/run</em>) directories are nowadays usually located in memory.

                  <p class="block">
                    <em class="important">However, there&#039;s an important condition if the backups should be triggered automatically by the <em class="italic">Cron</em> scheduler. In that case, the <em class="italic">/tmp</em> directory must stay writable during archiving.</em> This isn&#039;t luckily any issue, because the temporary files are usually deleted when the operating system starts. And that&#039;s the case after restoring whole system as well. There&#039;s therefore no need to backup the <em class="italic">/tmp</em> or <em class="italic">/var/tmp</em> filesystems.
                  </p>
                  <p class="block">
                    Let&#039;s look at two examples of the filesystem layout. The first layout contains many separate filesystems and most of them are located on <em class="italic">LVM</em>. Even those that can be mounted read-only during normal operation such as the <em class="italic">/usr</em> or <em class="italic">/</em> filesystems. The <em class="italic">LVM</em> read-only filesystems can be safely remounted read-write during the backup after their snapshots are created.

                    The advantage of the first layout is obviously the fact that the downtime of services provided by the backed-up host is minimal. It&#039;s necessary just to stop most services, remount filesystems read-only, create snapshots, remount filesystems back read-write and the services may be started again after that because the read-only filesystems and frozen snapshots are being backed-up. The second layout enforces remounting the root <em class="italic">/</em> filesystem read-only during the whole backup which necessitates shutting down most services during the whole period.

                    If you want to automate the backups, i.e. invoke the backup commands from the <em class="italic">Cron</em> scheduler, or if you want to trigger the backup centrally from one point for the whole set of hosts (or potentially from more points for a few subsets of hosts) by using <em class="italic">tar-lvm-all</em>, you need to have your mail system configured properly on all hosts running the backup scripts. <em class="italic">Cron</em> must be able to deliver potential errors that cannot be written to the logs (e.g. if the backup storage isn&#039;t mounted yet) or do not belong there. And the same applies for the <em class="italic">tar-lvm-one</em> scripts invoked on each host by the <em class="italic">tar-lvm-all</em> script running centrally - some errors can be delivered just by email.
                  </p>
                  <p class="block">
                    The <em class="italic">tar-lvm-all</em> script can be configured to instruct the backup scripts on each host not to use local <em class="italic">MTA</em>, but directly the <em class="italic">SMTP</em> protocol to connect to some mail server, but that&#039;s not the preferred solution. If the delivery fails, there&#039;s neither a way how to inform about the error nor any later repeated delivery attempt. The error output can get lost easily.

                    The simplest configuration of the whole mail system could be implemented as follows. Let&#039;s configure one host as the destination host for your email domain - either with separate mailboxes or with a catch-all mailbox depending on your needs. All other hosts could be configured to relay everything excluding mails to root to the destination server prepared earlier. This can be achieved relatively easily by using <em class="italic">Postfix</em>, for instance. If it is in default configuration that delivers emails to local mailboxes, it should be sufficient to add or update just a few configuration directives in the <span class="file">/etc/postfix/main.cf</span> file.
