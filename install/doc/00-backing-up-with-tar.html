                    This article explains how to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar">GNU tar</a> to create a <em class="italic">Linux</em> based operating system backup and how to restore it later if needed. It assumes that the filesystems to backup are the traditional <em class="italic">Linux</em> <em class="italic">ext2</em> based filesystems, i.e. of type <em class="italic">ext2</em>, <em class="italic">ext3</em> or <em class="italic">ext4</em>, or widely used <em class="italic">xfs</em> or relatively new <em class="italic">btrfs</em> filesystems. It was tested that these filesystems can be fully restored if proper arguments are given as explained later. The described steps should work for other <em class="italic">Linux</em> filesystems as well if they&#039;re able to store all standard <em class="italic">Linux</em> file types and attributes, but that wasn&#039;t confirmed at the time of this writing. However, it was successfully tested that <em class="italic">GNU tar</em> is able to backup one filesystem of the aforementioned type and restore it to another type. Later versions of <em class="italic">GNU tar</em> (e.g. version 1.27.1) support even <em class="italic">POSIX ACLs</em> and can be used to perform not just full, but incremental backups as well.

                  <p class="block">
                    <em class="italic">GNU tar</em> is capable of archiving all <em class="italic">Linux</em> file types except unix domain sockets. However, the file of this type normally exists only if the process that created it is running unless the process exits abnormally. Hence, this isn&#039;t an issue. All other file types including regular files, directories, symbolic links, named pipes and character and block devices are stored. All important information about these file types is contained in the archive: filenames, permissions, owner, group, modification time, symbolic link target and major and minor device numbers. Hard links are stored and extracted properly too if they&#039;re put into the same archive. <em class="italic">GNU tar</em> can also handle sparse files efficiently, but only if it obtains the <code class="code">--sparse</code> option during the backup. Later <em class="italic">GNU tar</em> versions are able to backup and restore <em class="italic">POSIX ACLs</em> if the <code class="code">--acls</code> argument is given to <code class="code">tar</code> during both creating and restoring the archive. However, the special <code class="code">lost+found</code> directory in the root directory of an <em class="italic">ext2</em> based filesystem is treated as a usual directory and should be therefore excluded from the backup by using the <code class="code">--exclude</code> option.
                  </p>
                  <p class="block">
                    Furthermore, <em class="italic">GNU tar</em> can create incremental backups if it is called with the <code class="code">-g</code> switch. It uses <em class="italic">ctime</em> (time of last modification of file status information) to determine whether the file or its status has changed. This is a second best choice after using hashes because if the file contents changes, the <em class="italic">mtime</em> (modification time) and therefore also the <em class="italic">ctime</em> change. However, if the file is only accessed and <em class="italic">atime</em> (access time) is modified, <em class="italic">ctime</em> remains unaltered. If only the file status changes (permissions, owner, group etc.), <em class="italic">ctime</em> is also updated. The only drawback of this method is that it is necessary to maintain correct system time. It is not possible to modify <em class="italic">ctime</em> arbitrarily by using some command, but if the system time changes, later modifications may occur as older ones and the incremental backup will unfortunately not contain such files. You should also take into account that the <code class="code">-g</code> switch requires an argument denoting the path to so called snapshot archive. The snapshot archive contains additional information that is necessary to determine whether a file should be included into the incremental archive or not. More precisely, the snapshot archive contains the list of all files and their <em class="italic">ctimes</em>.

                    If you want to create consistent operating system backup, you need to backup a snapshot of all partitions where the system is installed. This can be accomplished either by shutting down the system and backing it up (e.g. from a live CD) or by stopping all processes that are writing to the filesystems to backup, remounting them read-only and then performing a consistent backup.
                  </p>
                  <p class="block">
                    The latter approach doesn&#039;t require to stop the system. Moreover, it can be further improved by using a technology that is able to create filesystem snapshots at a particular time. <em class="italic">LVM</em> (Logical Volume Management) can be used for this purpose if you have enough free space in the volume group containing logical volumes with data. The writing processes can be then stopped and the filesystems remounted read-only just for the moment of creating snapshots. The system can continue running after that and the backup can be performed on the snapshots instead of on the running system.
                  </p>
                  <p class="block">
                    Let&#039;s now look at the concrete commands that can be used to backup an operating system snapshot. Let&#039;s remount all filesystems read-only at first.

The <code class="code">--one-file-system</code> option instructs <code class="code">tar</code> not to archive files from other filesystems.

Bare in mind that the special <code class="code">lost+found</code> directory of an <em class="italic">ext2</em> based filesystem should be always excluded from the backup because it is restored as a usual directory. The <code class="code">-g</code> option is not necessary. However, you must pass it to <code class="code">tar</code> in order to create subsequent incremental backup(s) later. The <code class="code">-g</code> switch defines the filename of so called snapshot archive with additional metadata to identify files whose attributes or contents changed since the preceding backup.

                    It&#039;s possible to use <em class="italic">GNU tar</em> to backup and restore whole <em class="italic">Linux</em> operating system. The backup can be done while the system is running, but you must ensure that you&#039;re backing up a consistent snapshot of the operating system.

                    The described method should work for any <em class="italic">Linux</em> distribution because the <em class="italic">GNU</em> implementation of the standard <em class="italic">tar</em> command should be part of it. Even if it is not, you could backup from a live CD distribution from time to time. <em class="italic">GNU tar</em> should be able to store all permanent <em class="italic">Linux</em> file types and important attributes and the procedure should thus work for most <em class="italic">Linux</em> filesystems. This method was fully tested only on <em class="italic">ext2</em> based filesystems and partially on <em class="italic">xfs</em> and <em class="italic">btrfs</em> and it was used to restore several different installations of <em class="italic">Debian</em> <em class="italic">squeeze</em>, <em class="italic">wheezy</em> and <em class="italic">jessie</em> and also of <em class="italic">CentOS 7</em>. No problem occurred after the whole system was restored, all permissions and all important attributes were maintained as explained above.
